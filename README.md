# Icons

Icons is a small Sinatra app that makes it easier to manage and preview the icon sets you have. It's still *very* rouge around the edges. 

Adding your icon sets:

* Copy your icons into a directory underneath `/public/icons` (ex. `/public/icons/silk-icons`)
* Put a file named README in this directory. There's an example README in the icons directory you can copy.

## Todo List

* Clean up stylesheets
* Figure out how to manage multiple icon sizes within a set
* Filter icon sets by tags
