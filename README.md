# Icons

Icons was a small experiment with Sinatra to manage and preview all of the icon sets I had laying around for web projects. It's *very* rough. 

Adding your icon sets:

* Copy your icons into a directory underneath `/public/icons` (ex. `/public/icons/silk-icons`)
* Put a file named README in this directory. There's an example README in the icons directory you can copy.
